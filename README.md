# About Me:
Fullstack Developer with 2 years of experience in building scalable web applications, both on the frontend and backend. Proficient in CSS, SCSS, React.js, Vue.js, Nuxt, Next, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and REST API.

I have hands-on experience in Python application development and a strong background in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I have successfully designed and implemented CRM systems and completed diverse development tasks, ensuring robust and efficient solutions tailored to client needs.

On the backend, I have developed and maintained services using Node.js and Express, with expertise in both relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SqLite) and non-relational (MongoDB, Redis) databases and ORM (TypeOrm, Prisma). My responsibilities have included writing and optimizing complex SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and microservices with using Queue (Bull.js).

On the frontend, I have built and optimized interfaces for speed, responsiveness, and SEO. My experience extends to containerizing applications with Docker, deploying projects via Nginx, managing hosting environments, and implementing caching strategies for performance improvement.

I am well-versed in RESTful API development and integration, and I strive for excellence by adhering to best practices in all my projects.
